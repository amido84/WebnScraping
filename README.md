# [Web Scraping](https://github.com/amido84/WebnScraping/blob/main/Webscraping.ipynb)


I performed web scraping using Selenium on ten pages from www.indeed.com to collect job listings. Based on the gathered data, I constructed a Pandas data frame containing the following details: job title, company name, location, and a summary of the job description.

Furthermore, I incorporated additional indicator columns in the data frame, assigning Boolean values (True/False) to indicate the presence of specific keywords within the job descriptions. The keywords considered include Python, SQL, AWS, RESTFUL, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Text Mining, NLP, SAS, Tableau, Sagemaker, TensorFlow, and Spark.
