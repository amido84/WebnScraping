Perform web scraping on 10 pages from www.indeed.com to gather job listings. Create a pandas DataFrame that includes the following information: job title, company name, location, and job description summary.

Additionally, include indicator columns with Boolean values (True/False) to indicate the presence of specific keywords in the job description. The keywords to consider are Python, SQL, AWS, RESTFUL, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Text Mining, NLP, SAS, Tableau, Sagemaker, TensorFlow, and Spark.

Please note that the last page to scrape will have the URL: https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=data+scientist&l=CO&start=90.
